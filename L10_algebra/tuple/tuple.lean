# Tuple Representation: Fin n → α

A sequence is given its ordering by a function from ordered
indices to the values needing order. We will repersent finite
ordered α n-tuples as functions from {0, ..., n-1} index sets
to α values.

## Structures on Fin n → α

Many algebraic structures on *Fin n → α* are already defined
in Lean's libraries. Here are just a few examples. A *zero* is
defined and has notation, 0.

### HSMul α (Fin n → α)

One structure on Fin n → α that we'll need is scalar
multiplication, with notation, of an α-valued scalar
by a Fin n → α tuple. You can see that Lean does not
provide an instance by uncommenting #synth.
